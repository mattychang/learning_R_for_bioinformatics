# Module 1: Getting Started

Goal 1: learn basic syntax, data types, and simple operations. \\
Goal 2: get familiar with how to use RStudio

## Navigating RStudio

When you open RStudio, you'll see **four main panes**:

### 1. Script Editor (Top Left)
This is where you write your code and save it in `.R` script files.
- Use this to draft and edit files like `01_basic_syntax.R`
- Run a line: place your cursor on a line and press:
  - `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux)
  - `Cmd + Enter` (Mac)
- Save your script: `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`

### 2. Console (Bottom Left)
This is where code runs.
- Type commands directly here if you donâ€™t want to save them
- Outputs and error messages will appear here

### 3. Environment / History (Top Right)
- **Environment** shows all your variables (e.g., `x <- 5`)
- **History** shows previously run commands

### 4. Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer (Bottom Right)
- **Files**: See files in your working directory
- **Plots**: Displays visualizations
- **Packages**: Manage installed packages
- **Help**: Search for function documentation (e.g., `?mean`)
- **Viewer**: Displays web content or R Markdown output

## How to Run Code

1. Open `01_basic_syntax.R` in the script editor
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to run each line
3. Watch results in the Console
4. Check created variables in the Environment tab
