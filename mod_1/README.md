# Module 1: R Fundamentals

This module introduces the foundational building blocks of R programming. It discusses data types, data structures, control flow, and essential file input/output operations - all of which you will need for bioinformatics.

## Learning Goals

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand and use different **atomic data types**
- Create and manipulate **vectors**, **data frames**, and **matrices**
- Use **control structures** to automate tasks and make decisions
- Manage your **working directory** and import/export files
- Understand how R’s **environment** handles variables and objects
